# Prebid Universal Creative

Prebid Universal Creative is a javascript api to render multiple formats. This file is inserted into the prebid creative as a placeholder for the winning prebid creative. It should support the following formats:
 - Banner
 - Outstream Video
 - Mobile (Coming Soon)
 - AMP creatives
 - All safeFrame creatives

## Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/prebid/prebid-universal-creative.git
    $ cd prebid-universal-creative
    $ npm install

*Note:* You need to have `NodeJS` 10.x.x or greater installed.

*Note:* We have upgraded from Gulp v3.9.1 to Gulp v4.0.2. In accordance with the change, you need to have `gulp-cli` installed globally. This won't impact any other project using `Gulp`.

If you already have `Gulp` installed globally, you need to uninstall it before installing `gulp-cli`. You can run `gulp -v` and check the version in the `CLI` field in the output to see if it's installed. If it's major version is `2`, you already have `gulp-cli` installed. If it's same as the `Local` field, you need to uninstall `Gulp` globally.

To uninstall the old package globally, run the command: `npm uninstall -g gulp`. <br />
To install `gulp-cli` globally, run the command: `npm install -g gulp-cli`.

Run `gulp -v` just to make sure that the `CLI` major version is `2`.

## Build for development

    $ gulp serve

Starts a web server at `http://localhost:9999` serving from the project root and generates the following files:

+ `./build/creative.js` - Full source code for dev and debug
+ `./build/creative.js.map` - Source map for dev and debug

## Build for production

We publish `prebid-universal-creative` as npm package on npmjs.com

When we run `npm publish`, prepublish script of package.json is executed. Scripts given in prepublish Run BEFORE the package is packed and published. See https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts

`gulp build` is executed before publish. It creates two files in dist directory

+ `./dist/creative.js` - Minified creative.js source code
+ `./dist/creative.max.js` - Unminified source code to help in debugging.

[jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) â€“ Open Source CDN is used to serve creative.js file.

## Test

We like to test a lot before releasing newer versions. 

   ```
   gulp test // Run unit tests in your local environment
   ```

   Set the environment variables. You may want to add these to your `~/.bashrc` for convenience.

   ```
   export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME="my browserstack username"
   export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY="my browserstack access key"
   ```
   
   ```
   gulp test --browserstack
   ```

   For End to End testing, 
   - Set `test.localhost` in your hosts file. 
   - Use node version <=8.1.2 since gulp-connect is having a bug in ssl mode. More info here https://github.com/intesso/connect-livereload/issues/79

   ```
   gulp test --e2e --https
   ``` 

   Reason to add specific host to your host file is
   - To test against your local build, we had to give local path in dfp creative. Redirecting request is not possible in browserstack.
   - On localhost domain you do not receive bid from certain SSP's, hence you have to have some host defined in hosts file. As of now we are using `test.localhost` defined in local host file as well as `DFP creative`.
